# graphql-test

Playing around with graphql! I decided to build a "Country of the day" app. I just collect some info and serve it.
Later on I decided to build my own graphql data server to integrate some info and simplify my client.

## TODO

- add newsapi.org reference
- dockerize
- improve design (a lot)
- add instructions on how to run the app
- Nice to have, add mark in world map (how?)
- add current time in that country
- cache news response for a day in the server
